# Two Talk

## About
Two Talk is a compact semantic shorthand system built for fast, structured notetaking, clear task lists, and lightweight digital bullet journals. It turns everyday notes into tiny, consistent building blocks you can type at the speed of thought.

- **What:** A keyboard native micro language where every word is made from two symbols, each contributing meaning.
- **Why:** Fast, flexible, and language agnostic. Once you learn the 12 base symbols, you can decode any pair.
- **How:** 1st Symbol = Object. 2nd Symbol = Idea and Action.

## Symbols
- @ = person / role / assign
- \# = item / structure / build
- ~ = process / method / execute
- : = time / schedule / plan
- ^ = place / context / locate
- " = message / information / communicate
- % = resource / value / allocate
- * = state / quality / adjust
- ? = unknown / ambiguity / explore
- > = outcome / progress / advance
- < = issue / constraint / reduce
- = = baseline / consistency / maintain

## Tips
- **Subjects:** Start lines with the subject for easy scanning (EG @# vs #@).
- **Triplets:** Use the 1st word for Nouns, 2nd for Status, and 3rd for Actions.
- **Directions:** Use < for origins/inputs/past and > for goals/outputs/future.
- **Mirrors:** Swap order to change context (EG ~# vs #~).
- **Literals:** Use Arabic numerals for counts, initials for names, and number formats for dates.
- **Doubles:** Use double symbols (@@, ##) for your most frequent, recurring items.

## Quick Reference
- @@ = person; role; assign
- @> = leader; progress; advance
- \#@ = item; role; assign
- \#= = template; consistency; maintain
- \#? = asset; ambiguity; explore
- :> = horizon; progress; advance
- =: = today; schedule; plan
- ~> = review; progress; advance
- "> = alert; progress; advance
- "< = reply; constraint; reduce
- %> = profit; progress; advance
- %< = loss; constraint; reduce
- *> = boost; progress; advance
- *? = risk; ambiguity; explore
