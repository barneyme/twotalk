# ABOUT

```
Two Talk is a semantic micro-notation system designed for speed in the digital age.
While traditional shorthand systems require years of practice and a physical pen,
Two Talk uses the universal symbols already on your keyboard to map out meaning
rather than sounds. It's 60 % more concise than English, works across language
barriers, and is built to help you capture the "essence" of a thought before it
escapes your brain. Two Talk is great for meeting notetaking, task tracking, bullet
journaling and brain dumping in personal knowledge management systems.
```
```
TLDR: Two Talk is a concise digital notation system.

# LEARN TWO TALK

```
This guide is designed to help you learn Two Talk in under 5 minutes.
```
### 1. Core Concept

```
CATEGORY + MODIFIER = Word
1 st symbol = WHAT (Category) | 2 nd symbol = HOW (Modifier)
```
### 2. Building Words

```
Combine categories and modifiers logically:
```
```
Self/Me @ (Life) + 1 (Single) = @
```
```
Friend @ (Life) + + (Positive) = @+
```
```
Enemy @ (Life) + - (Negative) = @-
```
```
Leader @ (Life) +! (Great) = @!
```
### 3. Building Sentences

```
No grammar rules—just chain meaning blocks together:
```
```
SCENARIO TWO TALK CHAIN
```
```
"The boss shared a good idea" / "Leadership
communication was positive"
```
```
@! " +^
(Leader + Communicate +
Good-idea)
```
```
"Work on the important project" / "High priority task"
```
```
#! !#
(Work + Important-object)
```

```
SCENARIO TWO TALK CHAIN
```
```
"We need to discuss the budget" / "Money question"
```
```
%# ?#
(Value/Money + Question-
object)
```
### 4. Meeting Essentials Cheat Sheet

_Commonly used Two Talk words for quick meeting capture:_

```
@3 Attendees/Team # D ) eliverable/Result :! Deadline/Now? T # opic/Agenda
```
```
!=
Decision/Confirmed /!^ Cancelled/No =+^ Agreement
```
```
%#
Budget/Cost
```
```
>( Next Step/Start ~> In Progress ") Report/Summary *! Tech/System
```
```
See the pattern? You're thinking logically, not memorizing. The order and context make
the meaning clear.
```
