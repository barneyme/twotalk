# TWO TALK
## Concise Semantic Notation System

## INTRODUCTION

Two Talk is a semantic shorthand system that uses logic-based symbols to represent complex ideas. It is designed for rapid notetaking and task management in situations where speed and accuracy are important. Using standard ASCII symbols on the keyboard Two Talk is digital native, cross-platform, plaintext, portable, parsable, serializable and AI friendly. By focusing on meaning (semantics), notes are reduced to predictable 2 symbol pairs that can be interpreted by anyone. All you have to do is remember the 12 symbols. For example if you know that `@` is Person and `+` is Large, you can figure out that `@+` is a Leader - even if you've never seen it written down before.

## RULES

- **Pairs:** Every "word" is a two-symbol pair [Category]+[Modifier].
- **Context (`**`):** Use `**` (TOPIC) to set the subject for a section.
- **Compounds:** Use a dot (`.`) to join pairs for complex words.
- **Names:** Use initials for names and identifiers.
- **Amounts:** Use numbers to show quantity.
- **Dates:** Write dates in ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) format.

## EXAMPLES

| English | Two Talk |
|---------|----------|
| The project needs more time on the calendar | `^^ ** #:` |
| The task is getting close to the deadline | `## :! :?` |
| The team is assembling for the meeting starting now | `@@ :*` |
| The site is far from the office | `^* ^@ ^:` |

## SYMBOLS

| Symbol | Meaning | Visual Mnemonic |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `@` | Person | looks like a head |
| `#` | Object | looks like a box |
| `:` | Time | looks like dots on a clock |
| `^` | Place | looks like a roof or a peak |
| `*` | Action | looks like a spark |
| `"` | Data | looks like speech quotes |
| `!` | Fact | looks like an exclamation point |
| `?` | Query | looks like a question mark |
| `+` | Large | looks like a plus sign |
| `-` | Small | looks like a minus sign |
| `=` | Same | looks like an equal sign |
| `/` | None | looks like a cancel mark |

## QUICK START GUIDE

Learn Two Talk in 5 steps.

### 1. What is Two Talk?

Two Talk is a simple notation system that replaces words with 2 symbol pairs. Each symbol has a meaning. Every symbol pair can convey an object, idea and action. By knowing just 12 symbols and their meanings you can write everything you need.

**Example:**
- English: "The manager needs to review the budget report"
- Two Talk: `:@ *" #^."`
- **13 words → 3 symbol pairs = 77% shorter**

### 2. Learn the 12 symbols

Each symbol represents a category. Memorize these symbols and meanings first:

| Symbol | Category | Mnemonic |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `@` | PERSON | looks like a head |
| `#` | OBJECT | looks like a box |
| `:` | TIME | looks like dots on a clock |
| `^` | PLACE | looks like a roof or a peak |
| `*` | ACTION | looks like a spark |
| `"` | DATA | looks like speech quotes |
| `!` | FACT | looks like an exclamation point |
| `?` | QUERY | looks like a question mark |
| `+` | LARGE | looks like a plus sign |
| `-` | SMALL | looks like a minus sign |
| `=` | SAME | looks like an equal sign |
| `/` | NONE | looks like a cancel mark |

### 3. Your first Two Talk notation

Let's translate: **"The team needs help"**

1. Identify concepts: team (group of people), needs (requires), help (assistance)
2. Pick symbols: `@@` (Group), `*"` (Assist/Help)
3. Drop filler: "the", "needs" → just keep core meaning
4. Result: `@@ *"`

Use the word list below to find a symbol pair suggestion for any concept.

### 4. Taking meeting notes

**Meeting dialogue → Two Talk notes:**

**Original (87 words):**
> "We need to launch the new website by next Friday. The design team finished their work yesterday. Marketing will review the content today. The CEO wants a final demo on Thursday. Budget approval is still pending from finance."

**Two Talk (9 symbols):**
```
** ^".
+* 2026-02-07
@# :" =*
@" :: *"
+@ :? *"
#^ ?:
```

**Translation:** Topic: Website | Launch Friday | Designers yesterday completed | Marketers today reviewing | CEO Thursday wants demo | Budget pending

**90% shorter, same information!**

### 5. Real example: daily standup

How a developer uses Two Talk for agile standups:

**Before:**
> "Yesterday I completed the user authentication module and fixed three bugs in the payment system. Today I'm working on the dashboard API integration. I'm blocked on getting database credentials from DevOps."

**After:**
```
:" @! =*
:" #^ 3 *-
:: ^" **
!? #^ @^
```

**Translation:**
- Yesterday: auth done, 3 bugs fixed
- Today: dashboard work
- Blocked: DB creds from DevOps

**Result:** Your updates are recorded quickly. You spend more time coding, less time talking.
