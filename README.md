## Dictionary

The dictionary contains **suggested mappings** for common words.

Because Two Talk is a **semantic system**, you can—and should—invent your own word blocks using the symbol meanings defined in the Rules section.

Words are composed of:
- a **two-symbol code**, and
- a **semantic logic explanation**, not a phonetic spelling.

> The goal is *understanding at a glance*, not memorization.
