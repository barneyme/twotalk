# Two Talk

## About
Two Talk is a compact semantic shorthand system built for fast, structured notes, task lists, and digital bullet journals. It turns everyday notes into tiny, consistent building blocks you can type at the speed of thought. Two Talk is great for knowledge workers, project managers, note takers digital minimalists, developers, researchers, PKM users and anyone who prefers structure over prose!

- What: A symantic keyboard native micro language where every word is made from two symbols, each contributing meaning.
- Why: Fast to learn and use, flexible, and language agnostic. Once you learn the 16 symbols, you can decode any pair — even ones you’ve never seen.
- How: 1st Symbol = Object. 2nd Symbol = Idea and Action.
- Subjects: Start lines with the subject to make lists easy to read at a glance (e.g., @# for a Team Member vs. #@ for a User).
- Order: Arrange notes by Actor → Action → Target (e.g., @@ Sarah @" "Call client").
- Chronology: Use < for things in the past, issues, or inputs, and > for things in the future, goals, or outcomes.
- Mirroring: Swapping symbols flips the focus. /# is a Workflow (Process-led), while #/ is a Document (Item-led).
- Literals: Use standard digits for counts (5), initials for names (JD), and ISO formats for dates (2024-05-12).
- Doubles: Use double symbols for the "Pure" or "Intense" version of a category (e.g., !! for an Emergency or ## for a primary Tool).
- Compounds: For complex ideas, link two pairs with a dot. (e.g., #@.* for a User-Adjusted setting).

## Symbols
@ = Person / Role | Assign / Delegate

< = Issue / Past | Reduce / Restrict
= = Baseline / Standard | Maintain / Match
+ = Addition / Gain | Increase / Join
- = Subtraction / Gap | Remove / Simplify
\ = Support / Base | Underlay / Revert
