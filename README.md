# ABOUT

```
Two Talk is a semantic micro-notation system designed for speed in the digital age.
While traditional shorthand systems require years of practice and a physical pen,
Two Talk uses the universal symbols already on your keyboard to map out meaning
rather than sounds. It's 60 % more concise than English, works across language
barriers, and is built to help you capture the "essence" of a thought before it
escapes your brain. Two Talk is great for meeting notetaking, task tracking, bullet
journaling and brain dumping in personal knowledge management systems.
```
```
TLDR: Two Talk is a concise digital notation system.

# LEARN TWO TALK

```
This guide is designed to help you learn Two Talk in under 5 minutes.
```
### 1. Core Concept

```
CATEGORY + MODIFIER = Word
1 st symbol = WHAT (Category) | 2 nd symbol = HOW (Modifier)
```
### 2. Building Words

```
Combine categories and modifiers logically:
```
```
Self (Me) @ (Person) + 1 (Single) = @
```
```
Manager @ (Person) + + (Positive/Leader) = @+
```
```
Deadline : (Time) + # (Object/Work) = :#
```
```
Grateful + (Positive) + * (Energy) = +*
```
### 3. Tasks & Productivity

```
Track your workflow by modifying Objects (#) or Paths (~):
```
```
STATUS LOGIC TWO TALK
```
```
To-do / Pending Object + Question #?
```
```
In Progress Path + Energy ~*
```
```
Done / Complete Object + Stop #)
```
```
Urgent Fact + Positive + Path !+~
```

### 4. Bullet Journaling

_Summarize your day or mindset using Category + Modifier:_

```
"I am feeling focused" @1 !! (Person + Fact-Fact)
```
```
"I am tired and have low energy" @1 *- (Person + Energy-Negative)
```
```
"I am grateful for a win" +* !+ (Gratitude + Success)
```
### 5. Example Sentences

```
SCENARIO TWO TALK CHAIN
```
```
"The manager sent the urgent file" @+ (Lea^ d "> er^ + #! G^ !+~ ive + Data + Urgent)
```
```
"We need to have a meeting about budget" @3 (Tea^ m :"^ + % M! e^? et # ing + Audit + Topic)
```
```
"I am blocked on the task and need help" # (B / lo^ @< cke^ d ?~ + Get + Path/How)
```
```
The beauty of Two Talk is flexibility. If a symbol pair makes sense to you logically, it's a
valid word.
```
