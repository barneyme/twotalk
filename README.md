# Two Talk Guide

Two Talk is a minimalist, logographic conlang designed for the **Scientific Observer**. It favors a strict mathematical framework to map reality rather than the emotional nuances of traditional speech. While every base word consists of two symbols (a primary root and a secondary modifier), the language utilizes grammatical anchors to define tense and quantity, and a recursive dot-link to construct high-resolution technical concepts.

It is a language of **verified witness**, not of judgment.

## Rules & Grammar

### Rules

1. **Neutrality**  
   Witness statements, not judgments.  
   *“Mistake” = unpredicted output (`*?`).*

2. **State**  
   Systems are described by movement.  
   *“Broken” = action that has stopped (`*-`).*

3. **Proof**  
   Statements must end with verification:  
   - Proven (`!!`)  
   - Hypothesized (`??`)

4. **Agency**  
   Binary distinction between:
   - Choosing entities (`@`)
   - Acted-upon objects (`#`)

5. **Observation First**  
   Observe the past; hypothesize only the future.

6. **Factual Integrity**  
   Output must be verified by input truth.

### Grammar

1. **Two Symbols**  
   Every word is exactly **two symbols**.

2. **Anchors**  
   Use Time (`:`) or Logic (`&`) beats *before* a word to change tense or number.  
   - Example:  
     - `:< *<` = ate  
     - `++ @*` = workers

3. **Nominalization**  
   Link an Action (`*`) to Matter (`#`) to create a noun.  
   - Example:  
     - `*^ . ##` = movement

4. **SVO Order**  
   Subject–Verb–Object  
   - Example:  
     - `@@ *< #^ !!`  
       *(I eat plant — fact)*

5. **Dot-Link (`.`)**  
   Stacks beats for complex concepts.  
   - Example:  
     - `^: . &^` = solar system

6. **Operator Precedence**  
   Negation → AND → OR → IF–THEN → verification markers (last)

> While Two Talk is visually represented by 14 symbols, it is a fully **spoken language**.  
> Each symbol corresponds to a unique phonetic sound, producing *two-beat* words.  
> Speech is flat and even; anchors add initial emphasis, and proof markers control final intonation.
