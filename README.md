# ABOUT

```
Two Talk is a semantic micro-notation system designed for speed in the digital age.
While traditional shorthand systems require years of practice and a physical pen,
Two Talk uses the universal symbols already on your keyboard to map out meaning
rather than sounds. It's 60 % more concise than English, works across language
barriers, and is built to help you capture the "essence" of a thought before it
escapes your brain. Two Talk is great for meeting notetaking, task tracking, bullet
journaling and brain dumping in personal knowledge management systems.
```
```
TLDR: Two Talk is a concise digital notation system.

# LEARN TWO TALK

```
This guide is designed to help you learn Two Talk in under 5 minutes.
```
### 1. Core concept.

```
CATEGORY + MODIFIER = Word
1 st symbol = WHAT (Category) | 2 nd symbol = HOW (Modifier)
```
### 2. Building words.

```
Combine categories and modifiers logically:
```
```
Self (Me) @ (Person) + 1 (Single) = @
```
```
Manager @ (Person) + + (Positive/Leader) = @+
```
```
Deadline : (Time) + # (Object/Work) = :#
```
```
Grateful + (Positive) + * (Energy) = +*
```
### 3. Complex words.

```
For more complex ideas, you can join 2 Two Talk words together using a dot (.) to create a
single compound concept:
```
```
