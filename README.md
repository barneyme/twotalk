# Two Talk

**Two Talk** is a minimalist, logographic system designed for **zero-bias observation**. It treats communication as a data stream where reality is mapped through structural constraints rather than sentiment. By stripping away adjectives of value, it forces the speaker to describe utility, movement, and state.

## The Philosophy: The Scientific Observer
Two Talk is built on the principle of the **Verified Witness**. Traditional languages rely on emotional nuance and subjective interpretation; Two Talk utilizes a rigid mathematical framework to ensure that every statement remains a neutral record of a state or movement.

### Core Architecture: The 14 Roots
Both versions of Two Talk share the same semantic foundation:
* **14 Phonetic Roots:** A core set of symbols (e.g., `@` for Agent, `#` for Matter, `*` for Action).
* **Two-Beat Words:** Every word consists of exactly two symbols—a primary root and a secondary modifier.
* **Mathematical Predictability:** Meanings are logically deduced from their component parts, reducing cognitive load.

## 1. Two Talk Simple (Shorthand)
[**View Simple Documentation**](https://github.com/barneyme/twotalk/blob/main/simple.html)

**Two Talk Simple** is an optimized shorthand designed for high-speed professional environments. It functions as a rapid data-logging tool that strips away complex grammar to capture the "who, what, and when" of a situation.

* **Best Use:** Meeting notes, task tracking, rapid journaling, and project management.
* **Method:** Uses the 14x14 root system to represent status and nouns without the need for full sentence structure.
* **Logic:** Skips verbs and articles. You list the "beats" of an event to create a scannable record.
    * *Example:* `** PROJECT :! 2026-01-01` (Project deadline is Jan 1st).

## 2. Two Talk Complete (Conlang)
[**View Complete Documentation**](https://github.com/barneyme/twotalk/blob/main/complete.html)

**Two Talk Complete** is a full-fledged constructed language (conlang) that applies rigid mathematical grammar to ensure "epistemic rigor." It is designed for contexts where the distinction between known data and theoretical projection must be absolute.

* **Best Use:** Scientific documentation, technical logs, research notebooks, and zero-bias reporting.
* **Mandatory Proof:** Every sentence **must** end with a proof marker: `!!` for a Witnessed Fact or `??` for a Hypothesis.
* **Grammar Protocol:**
    * **Anchors:** Uses Time (`:`) or Logic (`&`) prefixes to define tense and plurality.
    * **Logical SVO:** Follows a strict Subject-Verb-Object order: `[Who] [Did What] [To What] [Proof]`.
    * **Dot-Link (`.`):** Used to stack logic-beats recursively for high-resolution technical concepts.
    * *Example:* `@@ *< #^ !!` (Self consumed matter [Fact]).

## Getting Started
1.  **Learn the Roots:** Familiarize yourself with the 14 symbols found in the [Guide](http://www.twotalk.org/TwoTalkGuide.pdf).
2.  **Start with Simple:** Use the 2-symbol pairs to tag your existing notes and tasks.
3.  **Graduate to Complete:** Use the full grammar for technical logs where you need to structurally separate what you *saw* from what you *think*.
