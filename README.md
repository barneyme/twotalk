# TWO TALK GUIDE

**Two Talk** is a semantic micro-notation system designed for the speed of the digital age. While traditional shorthand systems require years of practice and a physical pen, Two Talk uses the universal symbols already on your keyboard to map out meaning rather than sounds. It's **60% faster than English**, works across language barriers, and is built to help you capture the "essence" of a thought before it escapes your brain.

### Key Features
* **Fixed Arity (The 2-Symbol Rule):** Every "word" in Two Talk is exactly two symbols long - a **Category** and a **Modifier**.
* **Semantic Calculus:** It translates concepts rather than letters or sounds. One pair can fluidly act as a noun, verb, or adjective.
* **Cognitive Categories:** The 10 categories are based on how humans naturally "chunk" reality.
* **Compositional Chaining:** Stack your 2-symbol blocks. The first block is the Subject, and following blocks provide detail.
