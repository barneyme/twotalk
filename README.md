# Two Talk

## About
Two Talk is a concise semantic shorthand system for notetaking, todo lists, and digital bullet journals.

Words are built by combining two symbols.

## Getting started
- 1. Pick 5-10 symbol pairs you'll use daily from the Quick Reference.
- 2. Use Two Talk only for tasks, notes, and meetings at first.
- 3. Don't try to memorize everything at once.
- 4. Let patterns emerge naturally over 1-2 weeks.
- 5. Customize meanings to match your workflow.

## Rules
- Words are built from two symbols: category + modifier.
- First symbol = category (what)
- Second symbol = modifier (how)

## Categories
- `@` = People / Role
- `#` = Thing / Task
- `^` = Place / Context
- `:` = Time
- `~` = Action / Movement
- `*` = Status / Energy
- `%` = Value / Money
- `"` = Communicate / Message

## Modifiers
- `>` = Send / To / After
- `<` = Receive / From / Before
- `!` = Done / Confirmed
- `?` = Ask / Question / Unknown
- `+` = Start / Big / More
- `-` = Stop / Small / Less
- `=` = Continue / Same / Equal

## Literals
- Amounts: Use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) to express amounts.
- Dates: Express dates in your native language numeric format.
- Names: Use native language initials for people (e.g. JB for Jamie Bond).
- Compound: Join two words with a dot (.) for complex concepts (e.g. @3.~= = team collaboration).
