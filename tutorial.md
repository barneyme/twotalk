# Two Talk: A Fast‑Start Tutorial

Two Talk is a compact, keyboard‑native shorthand for rapid notes, tasks, and digital journaling. This tutorial walks you through the system step‑by‑step so you can start using it immediately.

## 1. The Core Idea: Two Symbols = One Word

Every Two Talk word is made of **two symbols**:

- **First symbol → Object** (what the note is about)  
- **Second symbol → Idea/Action** (what’s happening with it)

Think of it like LEGO pieces: each symbol has a meaning, and combining them creates a tiny semantic block.

## 2. Learn the 12 Base Symbols

You only need to memorize 12 meanings. Everything else is built from these.

- `@` = person / role / assign  
- `#` = item / structure / build  
- `~` = process / method / execute  
- `:` = time / schedule / plan  
- `^` = place / context / locate  
- `"` = message / information / communicate  
- `%` = resource / value / allocate  
- `*` = state / quality / adjust  
- `?` = unknown / ambiguity / explore  
- `>` = outcome / progress / advance  
- `<` = issue / constraint / reduce  
- `=` = baseline / consistency / maintain  

Once you know these, you can decode any pair.

## 3. How to Read a Two Talk Word

A word is always:

**Object + Idea/Action**

Examples:

- `@>` → leader  
- `#~` → document  
- `:*` → date  
- `%<` → loss  
- `~>` → review  

You don’t memorize these individually—you infer them from the symbol meanings.

## 4. The Three‑Word Pattern (Your Secret Weapon)

Two Talk becomes incredibly powerful when you use the **triplet pattern**:

1. **Noun** (what it is)  
2. **Status** (what’s true about it)  
3. **Action** (what needs to happen)

Example:

```
#: = task  
*> = boost  
~> = review  

#: *> ~>
```

This becomes a compact, readable micro‑sentence.

## 5. Tips for Writing Notes Quickly

### Start with the subject
This makes scanning easy.

```
@# *> ~>
```

### Use mirrors
Swap symbol order to flip meaning.

- `~#` = workflow  
- `#~` = document  

### Use `<` for past/inputs and `>` for future/outputs

```
#< = input  
#> = output
```

### Use doubles for recurring things

```
@@ = person  
## = tool
```

### Use numbers, initials, and dates freely

```
@: 3pm  
@# J.S.  
:* 2026‑01‑18
```

## 6. Taking Meeting Notes (Real Example)

Imagine a product meeting. Here’s how you might capture it:

```
@# *> ~>      (member boost review)
@: #~ :>      (attendee document horizon)
@* <# ?=      (reviewer defect pending)
#> :* ~>      (output date review)
%? *> ~:      (estimate boost routine)
```

Later, you can expand these into full sentences if needed.

## 7. Capturing To‑Dos Instantly

Two Talk excels at rapid task capture.

```
#: ~>      (task review)
#: :*      (task date)
#: <^      (task root cause)
#: *>      (task boost)
#: ~<      (task sprint)
```

## 8. Using Two Talk as a Digital Bullet Journal

Bullet journals rely on:

- tasks  
- events  
- notes  
- migrations  
- statuses  

Two Talk maps beautifully onto these:

- `#` → tasks  
- `::`, `:*`, `:=` → time blocks, dates, cadence  
- `""`, `*`, `%` → notes, comments, metrics  
- `<`, `>`, `=` → status changes  
- mirrors → context shifts  
- doubles → recurring items  

Example daily log:

```
=: #~ ~>      (today document review)
#: *> ~:      (task boost routine)
@: "< =:      (attendee reply today)
%" :* ~>      (metric date review)
```
